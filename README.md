# Recommender-systems
The code prepared as a part of the 'Recommender Systems Specialization' from University of Minnesota (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/recommender-systems)

The first assignment to the course 'Introduction to Recommender Systems' introduces non-personalized and lightly-personalized recommendations (see the file 1st_assignment). The dataset 'HW1-data' includes headers that provide movie ID and user ID (but not name). There is a second column that represents gender, with 1=female and 0=male. The rest of the cells are a 20x20 ratings matrix (user-movie ratings) where blank cells represent the lack of a rating.
